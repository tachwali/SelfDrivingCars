## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

## Compilation

### Your code should compile.

The code compiles without errors or warnings. No modifications were done on the provided setup.

## Implementation

### The Model

The Kinematic model used in this project neglects the interactions between the tires and the road. The model state equations are as follow:

```
x[t] = x[t-1] + v[t-1] * cos(psi[t-1]) * dt
y[t] = y[t-1] + v[t-1] * sin(psi[t-1]) * dt
psi[t] = psi[t-1] + v[t-1] / Lf * delta[t-1] * dt
v[t] = v[t-1] + a[t-1] * dt
cte[t] = f(x[t-1]) - y[t-1] + v[t-1] * sin(epsi[t-1]) * dt
epsi[t] = psi[t] - psides[t-1] + v[t-1] * delta[t-1] / Lf * dt
```

Where, the states are:

- `x, y` : Car coordinates.
- `psi` : Car orientation.
- `v` : Car velocity.
- `cte` : Cross-track error.
- `epsi` : Orientation error.

In addition to the states, `Lf` is the distance between the car center of mass and the front wheels (Its value is provided by Udacity's seed project and can be found experimentally). 

Also, we have the control input:

- `a` : Car acceleration.
- `delta` : Steering angle (in radian).

The predictive controller formulates an optimization problem that aims to minimize a cost function for a specific the acceleration (`a`) and the steering angle(`delta`). Finding those two control input values is the solution of this problem.

The objective function is a combination of different factors, the contribution of each factor to the total cost is tuned using some weight values that are set empirically (subjectively):

- State errors: Square sum of `cte` and `epsi`. It could be found [here](./src/MPC.cpp#L57).
- Actuator use: Square sum of the difference actuators to penalize a lot of actuator's actions. It could be found [here](./src/MPC.cpp#L64).
- Rate of actuator change: Square sum of the difference between two consecutive actuator values to penalize sharp changes. It could be found [here](./src/MPC.cpp#L70).


### Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

The number of points "N" and time step "dt" determine the scope of prediction. The number of points impacts directly the controller performance. Too many points resulted in slower controller. The number of points is set so that the prediction scope is comparable to waypoints on the simulator. I tried the range 5 to 15 for "N" and the range 100 to 500 milliseconds for "dt", and found to be the following values yielding best performance results:
"N" = 10 and "dt" = 100 milliseconds.

### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing

A 3rd-degree polynomial is fitted to the road waypoints after transforming it to car coordinates. The waypoints transformation is done at [./src/main.cpp](./src/main.cpp#L105) from line 105 to line 114. 
 The polynomial coefficients are used to calculate the error values "cte" and "epsi". They are also used by the solver to create a reference path (trajectory).

### Model Predictive Control with Latency

To actuator latency is captured in the state equations. The code implementing that could be found at [./src/main.cpp](./src/main.cpp#L119) from line 119 to line 136.

## Simulation

### The vehicle must successfully drive a lap around the track.

The car successfully drives a lap around the track.
