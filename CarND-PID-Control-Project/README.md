## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

## Compilation

### Your code should compile.

The code compiles without errors or warnings. No modifications were done on the provided setup.

## Implementation

### The PID procedure follows what was taught in the lessons.

The PID implementation is done on the [./src/PID.cpp](./src/PID.cpp). The [PID::UpdateError](./src/PID.cpp#L19) method calculates proportional, integral and derivative errors and the [PID::TotalError](./src/PID.cpp#L25) calculates the total error using the appropriate coefficients.

## Reflection

### Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

- The PID controller takes an error signal as an input and produces a steering signal at the output. The error is measured by the deviation of the car from center line.

- The PID controller has three gains that maps different properties of the error signal to an appropriate correcting steering signal.

1- The proportional gain (P) makes the steering signal propotional to the error value directly. This gain alone lacks the ability to correct for small errors or biases and can cause an overshoot for sudden large errors.

2- The integral gain (I) corrects for the bias problem since it makes the steering signal propotional to the integral of error over time. So, when there is a small error or bias, it will grow over time due to the integration until it becomes large enough to produce a steering signal that is sufficient to correct the error.

3- The differential gain (D) corrects the overshooting problem since it links the steering signal to the rate of change of error signal. So, when the error changes rapidly, it is possible to build a component of the steering signal to slow it down (reduce the total amount). 

### Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

The twiddle method was used. I started by setting the proportional gain alone. I continued to increase the gain until the car started to overshoot (go offroad on turns). Then I reduced the gain to 0.75 of the value I got with overshooting and added integral gain (I) until the car start to overshoot again. Then I added the differential gain to overcome the overshooting. The final parameters where [P: 0.1, I: 0.005, D: 4.0].
